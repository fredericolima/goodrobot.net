I really feel like writing some thoughts down. Here are some post ideas to work on:

3 Coding Ideas a week - this should be three ideas of quick and easy code ideas that might
take up to half a week to complete. The idea would be that I'd try to pump out these ideas
often enough and quickly enough that if I do not write it someone else will possibly take
it and run. This would force me to be creative and to spend more than the 5 minutes it takes
me to decide that I'm not creative enough to come up with any ideas. 

Not really sure if I want to talk much about my old job. There were some terrible things about
it, and working at my new job definitely makes me think there is no reason for anyone to 
tolerate the sort of disregard to employee hapiness that was going on there. On the other hand
I hate to disparage my own work and the work of the friends that I still have there. Not even 
sure what I want to say besides....see everything did not just end, but became AWESOME after I
switched jobs. They looked at it like I was the problem, and then got upset when I tried to remove
said problem from them. Well here my "issues" are non-issues. Which is nice cause I have to worry
less about them and can focus on my strengths and improving my real weaknesses. What it really
comes down to is this. I want to be awesome at my job. I want people to recognize that I am more
than some guy who sits down and writes out feature after feature. Most importantly, I want to
constantly strive and work towards being bigger than myself

* Mobile home page thingamajig
* Fancy bookmark page (possibly sync'ed off pinboard)
* Breakout the RPG
* Project pages for jekyll (not even sure what this means!)

Hrmm, that didn't seem to work right. I wonder what happened? Pancakes
