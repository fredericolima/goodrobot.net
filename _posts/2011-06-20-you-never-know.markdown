So, here we are. Starting fresh. A while ago I was goofing off and ended up
purchasing goodrobot.net. My plan was to migrate my notsoevil.net sites to the
new domain, but that got put on hold while I changed jobs, moved across the
country and then got my family out here and settled as well. 

And then came the monthly urge to re-write my blog theme, followed by the
inevitable putting that off, followed up yet once more by a "oh hey people like
[jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) I should play with that and see how it goes"...this continues on for
several months. Until, just now, where I am actually writing a goddamn post for
my new webpage. 

Anyhow, life's good and I'm hoping to keep this place from collecting so many
cobwebs. As I mentioned this site is now built off jekyll (if you're so inclined
you may fork it from here). I'm not really interested in doing an expanded post
about the tech behind it(see here, here and here), except that I will say this: It was fun, and I really
like [sass](http://sass-lang.com).
