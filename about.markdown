My name is JD Cantrell and I'm a web developer, husband, father and weiner
dog wrangler. For the last 7 years since I graduated college I have worked
with PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript professionally. I've been fortunate to
always be working for companies that have wanted to use the latest and 
greatest technologies. Which is pretty good for me because I love to learn
about new things. Outside of work I dabble with python (see: 
[intones](http://intones.notsoevil.net)) and play with various blogging
engines (the latest being jekyll as it is all the rage these days).

Anyhow I am currently located in San Francisco, CA and would be more than
happy to meetup/drink beer/talk tech with any other like minded individuals.
