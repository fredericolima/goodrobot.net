          <p>I really feel like writing some thoughts down. Here are some post ideas to work on:</p>

<p>3 Coding Ideas a week - this should be three ideas of quick and easy code ideas that might take up to half a week to complete. The idea would be that I&#8217;d try to pump out these ideas often enough and quickly enough that if I do not write it someone else will possibly take it and run. This would force me to be creative and to spend more than the 5 minutes it takes me to decide that I&#8217;m not creative enough to come up with any ideas.</p>

<p>Not really sure if I want to talk much about my old job. There were some terrible things about it, and working at my new job definitely makes me think there is no reason for anyone to tolerate the sort of disregard to employee hapiness that was going on there. On the other hand I hate to disparage my own work and the work of the friends that I still have there. Not even sure what I want to say besides&#8230;.see everything did not just end, but became AWESOME after I switched jobs. They looked at it like I was the problem, and then got upset when I tried to remove said problem from them. Well here my &#8220;issues&#8221; are non-issues. Which is nice cause I have to worry less about them and can focus on my strengths and improving my real weaknesses. What it really comes down to is this. I want to be awesome at my job. I want people to recognize that I am more than some guy who sits down and writes out feature after feature. Most importantly, I want to constantly strive and work towards being bigger than myself</p>

<li>Mobile home page thingamajig</li>

<li>Fancy bookmark page (possibly sync&#8217;ed off pinboard)</li>

<li>Breakout the RPG</li>

<li>Project pages for jekyll (not even sure what this means!)</li>

<li>Some sort of autowatcher/script run script (aka watchr)</li>

<li>update stuff</li>

          <p>Things todo:</p>

<ul>
<li>Normalize.css</li>

<li>CSS3 green gradient that looks awesome</li>

<li>Create the logo we want using either inkscape or something like it</li>

<li>Add enough graphical elements to the text and body of the page that it is still clean but looks elegant and well done</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='here_is_the_next_section'>Here is the next section</h2>

<p>Okay this will be a test post, we need to test the various elements of markdown and make sure we create some output that looks nice for it. So here is my first paragraph, nothing great, but hopefully there will be enough text that I can get my head around the different things</p>

<h1 id='let_me_tell_you_about_this_cool_thing_known_as_the_jekyll'>Let me tell you about this cool thing known as the jekyll</h1>

<p>This is a major topic, and so it was giving a big important looking heading you need to be careful and read this completely. Sometimes it will rain fish, or that just may be a myth. At this time no one really knows except what the internet tells us we know.</p>

<h2 id='more_headings'>More headings</h2>

<p>Okay one last thing before I go, let me just say that this will be a really short paragraph, I hope this will do the trick!.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think this is what pain feels like! Mommy, someone maternal! Get out of my way! Get out of my way!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not until you&#8217;ve given up everything that you can appreciate anything</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is some code:</p>
<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='python'>def load_feed(url, display, count, options):
	'''Uses feedparser to fetch feeds and parse through the correct display
	function'''
	if options.verbose:
		print &quot;Parsing %s(%d entries)...&quot; % (url, count)

	feed = feedparser.parse(url)
	output = ['']
	for entry in feed.entries[0:count]:
		output.append(display(entry))
	output.append('')
	return u'\n\t\t\t'.join(output)</code>
  </pre>
