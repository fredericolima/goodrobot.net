## Intones
Intones is a simple website built off Django and Amazon AWS with the goal
of helping me keep up to date with new band releases. It allows users to
keep a list of bands they are interested in and then view either a nicely
formatted (imho) web page or RSS feed to see if there are any upcoming
releases they might be interested in.

## Ankh
Initially written to replace a lifestream plugin that wasn't living up to my
expectations, Ankh, in essence, is an RSS feed reader and parser. With Ankh 
you create an HTML template and then have Ankh parse and fill in the latest
feed data.

## Vimes
I needed an easy to use and more beautiful todo list manager. So enter Vimes.
Created with flask on the backend and jquery on the front and leveraging
content editable it is a pretty straightforward to use system.

## Upcoming Projects
Here are a few ideas/back burner things that I'm thinking about or hoping
someone else will right so I don't have to ;)

* A nice pinboard.in aggregator - should group by tags
* A site generator that will take a directory of music and create:
 * An easy to use interface to play music
 * Easy links to fully download music in a folder
 * Utilize HTML5 and potentially flash and look good on a TV
